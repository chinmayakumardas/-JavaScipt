# Chinmaya Kumar Das's JavaScript Learning Journey

## Constantly Learning JavaScript

I'm Chinmaya Kumar Das, and I'm committed to constantly learning and upskilling myself in JavaScript. This repository is a collection of my daily JavaScript exercises and projects, where I'm challenging myself to improve my skills and knowledge in the language.

## Daily Challenges

Each day, I'll add a new JavaScript challenge or exercise to this repository. These challenges will cover a range of topics, including:

* JavaScript fundamentals (variables, data types, functions, etc.)
* DOM manipulation and events
* Algorithms and data structures
* Advanced JavaScript concepts (async/await, promises, etc.)

## My Goal

My goal is to continuously improve my JavaScript skills and knowledge, and to become proficient in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.

## How to Follow Along

You can follow along with my learning journey by checking out the daily challenges in this repository. I'll be committing new exercises and projects regularly, so be sure to star this repository to stay up-to-date.

## Let's Learn Together!

I'm excited to share my learning journey with you, and I hope you'll join me on this path to JavaScript mastery!
